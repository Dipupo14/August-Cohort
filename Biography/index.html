        Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu was born in Lagos, Nigeria to the illustrious Tinubu Family of Lagos State. He attended Richard Daley College, Chicago Illinois, where he earned himself a place in the honors list of the College. He subsequently proceeded to the Chicago State University, Illinois where he obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration (Accounting and Management).
During his undergraduate years, he was honored with the Outstanding Student’s Award, The University Scholar’s Award and the Certificate of Merit in Accounting and Finance.
On his arrival in the U.S. in 1975 and with the support of an ever-adoring mother, this courageous youth, faced with an unflinching zeal to succeed, took on such menial jobs as dishwashing, night-guard and cab-driving to see himself through the initial difficulties of school at the Richard Daley College, Chicago, Illinois.

The brilliance of this young Nigerian showed in his ability to make the honours’ list of Richard Daley College. He subsequently transferred to the Chicago State University, Illinois, graduating with honours in 1979 and earning a Bachelor’s Degree in Business Administration (Accounting and Management). During his first year in Chicago State University, young Bola was given the rare privilege to partly teach other students of his Faculty remedial tutorial classes. Most of his colleagues and contemporaries at the university attributed their improved grades to his tutorial lectures.

     <P>
Tinubu attended St. John's Primary School, Aroloya, Lagos before proceeding to Children Home School in Ibadan. He completed undergraduate studies in the United States, first at Richard J. Daley College in Chicago and then at Chicago State University. He graduated in 1979 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Accounting.
In the mid-1970s he moved to the United States, working at a variety of jobs while he finished his college education. Transcripts show that Tinubu attended Southwest College (now Richard J. Daley College) in Chicago and then transferred to Chicago State University, where he earned a B.S. in business and administration in 1979. Accounting had been the focus of his studies, and he recalls that he soon found work as an accountant with various U.S. consulting firms. Tinubu returned to Nigeria in the 1980s and worked for Mobile Oil as an auditor, later rising in the ranks there. In 1987 he married his wife, Oluremi Tinubu. He is the father of six children. 
Throughout his undergraduate years, young Bola was on the Dean’s List and was honoured with the Outstanding Student’s Award, the University Scholar’s Award and the Certificate of Merit in Accounting and Finance. He was also awarded the prestigious Sumna cum laude for scoring 3.54 out of possible 4.0 GP.
 
With his successful academic profile, young Bola contested and won his first political election as the President of the Accounting Society of the institution in his final year at the University.

     <h2><center><em style="color: brown;">POLITICAL LIFE</em></center></h2>
     <P>
        Tinubu was elected to the Lagos West senate seat in 1992 as part of the Social Democratic Party (SDP). In the wake of the country’s annulled presidential election in 1993 and Gen. Sani Abacha’s subsequent seizure of power later that year, Tinubu became active in a pro-democracy group, the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO). He was initially jailed for his pro-democracy activities before fleeing in exile in 1994; he returned to Nigeria after Abacha’s death in 1998.

In 1999 Tinubu—now part of the Alliance for Democracy (AD) party—was elected governor of Lagos state; he was reelected in 2003. During his two terms as governor, he was credited with improving the state’s finances through better enforcement of tax collection and for enacting a public transportation project to address the considerable traffic gridlock in Lagos. After stepping down in 2007, Tinubu’s reputation as a kingmaker grew, and he became known by the moniker “political godfather” as he used his influence to support candidates for various political offices, including choosing his successors as governor. Also during this time, he helped to form a new political party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), in 2013 and supported Muhammadu Buhari as the party’s presidential candidate in the country’s 2015 election. Buhari was successful, winning that year and again in 2019 for a second and final term.

Tinubu is said to be one of the wealthiest politicians in Nigeria. Over the years, he has been the subject of corruption-related allegations, many regarding the source of his considerable wealth and some relating to his time as governor of Lagos state. He was also accused of having profited from drug trafficking: in 1993 the United States government filed a complaint that accused him of having a bank account containing the proceeds from narcotics sales; as a result, some $460,000 was seized from a U.S. bank account in his name. However, Tinubu was not formally charged and has denied the allegations.

2023 election
With Buhari constitutionally limited to serving two terms, the APC selected Tinubu to be the party’s presidential candidate in the 2023 election. He was one of 18 candidates running for president; Tinubu, Atiku Abubakar of the People’s Democracy Party (PDP), and Peter Obi of the Labour Party were considered the front-runners. Like the other candidates, Tinubu focused his campaign on the main concerns of Nigerians: the increasing insecurity in the country as well as economic issues such as inflation and unemployment. He also vowed to make much needed infrastructure improvements. Tinubu campaigned with the slogan “Emi lokan”—Yoruban for “It’s my turn”—which irritated some voters who thought it signaled a sense of entitlement to the presidency. Others were bothered by his deviation from the tradition of having a mixed-faith ticket: instead of selecting a Christian running mate, Tinubu chose Kashim Shettima, who was Muslim like himself. Some voters were also concerned about his overall fitness for the office, citing his age and rumours of poor health.
